The Microsoft Copilot ecosystem for Helm Bank — from the front door at m365.cloud.microsoft to the intelligence layer that grounds it in your work context, to the five prompting techniques that determine whether you get generic output or precise, professional results.
:::

> *"The quality of your question determines the quality of your thinking."*
> — Peter Drucker

There is a version of Microsoft Copilot that is, frankly, underwhelming.

You type: *"Write me a report on commercial real estate."*

Copilot dutifully returns four paragraphs of polished, completely generic prose that could have been written about any bank in any city in any year. It reads like a Wikipedia summary. You could have found better with a three-second web search. You close the window, return to your keyboard, and quietly conclude that AI is probably overhyped.

There is a second version of Microsoft Copilot — the version that the top performers in every organization that has deployed it eventually discover. In this version, you type a different kind of prompt. Copilot pulls from your actual emails, your recent meeting transcripts, the spreadsheet your analyst shared yesterday, and the memo your compliance officer sent last Friday. It gives you a first draft that reflects your tone, incorporates your institution's specific numbers, and accounts for the regulatory context you operate in. It saves you forty-five minutes. Then it saves you another forty-five. Then it rewrites the way you work.

The difference between those two outcomes is not the software. It is the prompt.

This chapter is about the architecture that makes the second outcome possible — how Microsoft 365 Copilot actually works, where to find it, how it connects to your organizational data — and then the five prompting techniques that separate average users from power users. Master these, and Copilot stops being a curiosity and starts being your most capable colleague.

## 1. The Copilot Landscape: Not All Copilots Are Equal

Before we discuss prompting, we need to clear up a confusion that trips up most new users: **Microsoft has multiple products with "Copilot" in the name, and they are not the same thing.**

This is not a minor technical footnote. If you understand the distinction, you will know exactly which tool to reach for and why. If you don't, you'll end up frustrated that "Copilot" doesn't have access to your files — because you're using the wrong one.

:::{figure} ../images/ch05-front-door-m365.png
:label: fig-ch05-front-door
:alt: Microsoft 365 Copilot interface shown on desktop, web browser, and mobile side by side — a banking professional's chat session with Copilot visible on each screen, demonstrating cross-device access
:width: 80%
:align: center

Microsoft 365 Copilot is accessible across desktop, web, and mobile — all through the m365.cloud.microsoft portal. The same conversation, the same context, wherever you work.
:::

Think of it this way: imagine a hospital. They have a public information desk at the front entrance — anyone can walk in, ask questions, and get general health information. That's useful. But when you need a specialist who actually knows your medical history, who can look at your chart and make recommendations based on *your* specific situation, you see a physician with access to your full record. That is a fundamentally different kind of help.

**Copilot Chat** (free, included in your Microsoft account) is the public information desk. It is web-connected, it can answer general questions, it can help you write a cover letter or explain a news story — but by default, it does not have access to your Helm Bank emails, your SharePoint files, your Teams conversations, or any other organizational data. It is general-purpose. It is genuinely useful. But it is not your specialist.

**Microsoft 365 Copilot** (the paid license add-on that Helm Bank has deployed) is the physician with your chart. It knows your organizational context. It connects to Microsoft Graph — the intelligence layer that maps your emails, your meetings, your chats, and your documents — and it uses that context to give you responses grounded in *your* actual work. When you ask it to summarize the key points from your conversation with a relationship manager last Tuesday, it can actually do that. When you ask it to draft a memo based on the spreadsheet your analyst shared this morning, it can pull that file.

**Copilot Agents** are a third category: specialized, purpose-built AI assistants configured to handle specific workflows. A Copilot Agent might be designed specifically to handle loan document review, or to automate a compliance reporting workflow, or to answer customer questions from a specific product knowledge base. These are more advanced and, for most Helm Bank users in this course, are the horizon toward which we're building — the payoff of foundational mastery.

:::{important}
**The Security Point That Should Give You Confidence**

One of the most common concerns we hear from Helm Bank colleagues is: *"If Copilot can see all my organizational data, can it share my clients' information with someone else?"*

The answer is no — and the architecture makes this structurally impossible. Microsoft 365 Copilot only surfaces information that the **signed-in user already has permission to access**. If a loan officer doesn't have permission to view another relationship manager's client files, Copilot cannot show them those files. The same access controls, conditional access policies, and compliance frameworks that govern your M365 environment govern Copilot. Your customer data stays within the Microsoft 365 service boundary. It does not leave your tenant, it is not used to train Microsoft's AI models, and it is not accessible to other organizations.

This is not marketing language. It is the architecture. Understanding it removes a legitimate concern and lets you focus on what Copilot can actually do.
:::

## 2. The Front Door: m365.cloud.microsoft

Every powerful tool has an entry point. For Microsoft 365 Copilot, that entry point is **m365.cloud.microsoft** — the unified Microsoft 365 Copilot portal that brings together everything in one place.

Think of m365.cloud.microsoft the way you think of a bank's main branch lobby: it's not the only way to access services (you can also use the ATM, the drive-through, the mobile app), but it's the hub — the place where everything connects and where you can do the most, all in one location.

:::{figure} ../images/ch05-work-iq-intelligence.png
:label: fig-ch05-work-iq
:alt: Infographic showing Microsoft Graph as the intelligence layer connecting Copilot to organizational data — email, meetings, chats, files, and shared knowledge all flowing into Copilot, grounded in user permissions
:width: 80%
:align: center

The Microsoft Graph intelligence layer — how Copilot grounds its responses in your actual organizational context. Every response is personalized to what you have permission to access, not generic web content.
:::

**What you'll find at m365.cloud.microsoft:**

The portal gives you access to the full Microsoft 365 Copilot experience from your browser — the same capability available through the Microsoft 365 Copilot desktop app and the mobile app. You can start conversations, manage ongoing threads, use the Prompt Gallery (more on this shortly), and access all Copilot integrations from a single authenticated session.

**Three ways to access M365 Copilot:**

- **Web:** m365.cloud.microsoft — works in any modern browser, no installation required
- **Desktop:** The Microsoft 365 Copilot app, available through your Microsoft 365 installation
- **Mobile:** The Microsoft 365 Copilot mobile app (iOS and Android) — the same Copilot, on your phone, with the same access to your organizational data

:::{tip}
**Bookmark it now.** Open m365.cloud.microsoft in your browser and add it to your bookmarks bar. You'll use it daily. It takes four seconds, and it removes one more friction point between you and a tool that should feel like second nature.
:::

**Copilot embedded in the apps you already use:**

m365.cloud.microsoft is the standalone experience. But Microsoft 365 Copilot also lives inside every app in your M365 suite — and for most Helm Bank workflows, you'll use it there rather than switching to the portal.

- **In Word:** Copilot appears in the document margin. Ask it to draft a section, expand a paragraph, rewrite in a different tone, or summarize the document. You can reference a specific file from SharePoint by typing `/` and the file name in your prompt.
- **In Excel:** Copilot appears in the ribbon on the Home tab. It can analyze data in a table, generate formulas, create charts, identify trends, and surface outliers — without you needing to write a single formula manually.
- **In Outlook:** Copilot can draft email replies, summarize long email threads, and flag action items from your inbox.
- **In Teams:** Copilot can summarize meetings you missed, recap decisions made during a call, and list action items — pulling from the meeting transcript in real time.
- **In PowerPoint:** Copilot can generate slide decks from a document, reorganize presentations, and suggest design improvements.

The pattern across all of these is consistent: **you stay in the tool you're already using, and Copilot shows up as a natural part of the workflow.** You don't need to stop what you're doing and go somewhere else.

:::{note}
**A Word About File Access in Word and Copilot**

Microsoft's official guidance is important here: for Copilot to access a file when you're prompting in Word, **that file must be stored in SharePoint or OneDrive** — not just on your local hard drive. If a file lives only on your desktop or a local folder, Copilot cannot reach it. This is by design — it's part of the security boundary.

The practical implication for Helm Bank: store your working documents in SharePoint or OneDrive, not local drives. This is good practice regardless of AI — it ensures documents are backed up, version-controlled, and accessible to your team — but it's essential for Copilot to work as designed.
:::

**Microsoft 365 Copilot Search:**

The portal also includes **Microsoft 365 Copilot Search** — a universal search capability that works across all your M365 apps and connected third-party data. Instead of searching separately in Outlook, then SharePoint, then Teams, Copilot Search finds relevant content across your entire organizational ecosystem in a single query. For a relationship manager trying to find everything related to a specific client across emails, call notes, shared documents, and team chats — this alone is a significant capability.

## 3. Work IQ — The Intelligence Layer That Grounds Copilot in Your Context

Here is the feature that makes Microsoft 365 Copilot genuinely different from a general-purpose AI chatbot — and it is important enough that it deserves its own section.

When you ask a general AI tool a question, it answers from what it knows from training data — the internet, books, articles. That's valuable. But it doesn't know *you*. It doesn't know what happened in your portfolio review meeting last Tuesday. It doesn't know the memo your compliance team circulated last week. It doesn't know the deal terms your relationship manager just shared via email.

Microsoft 365 Copilot uses **Microsoft Graph** to close that gap.

**Microsoft Graph is the intelligence layer that maps your organizational context.** Think of it as the connective tissue of your Microsoft 365 environment — it knows which emails you've sent and received, which meetings you've attended, which documents you've created and accessed, which chats you've had in Teams, and which files your colleagues have shared with you. It maps the relationships between all of this information and maintains that map in real time.

When you submit a prompt to Microsoft 365 Copilot, the system does something called **grounding**: before generating a response, Copilot accesses Microsoft Graph within your tenant to pull in relevant context from your actual work. If you ask "Summarize what I need to prepare for the Riverside Holdings meeting tomorrow," Copilot doesn't just give you generic meeting prep advice — it looks at the meeting invitation, pulls the agenda, finds relevant emails from recent weeks, locates documents shared with the attendees, and synthesizes all of that into a personalized briefing.

This process — the prompt going in, the grounding against your Microsoft Graph data, and the response coming out — all happens within your organization's Microsoft 365 service boundary. Your data does not leave your tenant.

:::{note}
**The Permission Principle: How Grounding Stays Safe**

The grounding process is governed by a principle that is worth understanding clearly: **Copilot only surfaces information the signed-in user already has permission to access.**

This is not a policy statement. It is structural. Copilot doesn't have a special administrative view of your organization's data that bypasses your existing access controls. It uses Microsoft Graph with the same permissions as your account. If you don't have access to a file in SharePoint, Copilot cannot include that file in your responses. If a colleague's calendar is set to private, Copilot cannot see the details of their appointments.

For Helm Bank, this means: the existing security model that governs your M365 environment — including Conditional Access, MFA, and all other compliance controls — governs Copilot's access. No new exposure. The same guardrails, applied to AI-assisted work.
:::

**What grounding means in practice at Helm Bank:**

- A commercial lender asks Copilot to draft a credit memo. Copilot pulls the relevant loan application documents from SharePoint, the financial statements shared by the client via email, and the notes from the last underwriting committee discussion — all automatically, because they're already in the user's M365 environment.
- An operations manager asks Copilot to flag any compliance-related items from the last 30 days of email. Copilot searches the user's inbox for relevant threads and surfaces a prioritized summary.
- A relationship manager asks Copilot to prepare talking points for a client renewal conversation. Copilot finds the account history, recent correspondence, and product documentation in SharePoint and synthesizes key points for the meeting.

None of these require the user to manually attach files or paste content into the prompt. The intelligence layer does the retrieval automatically — because it already knows your work context.

**The analogy that makes this click:**

Imagine you have a brilliant new analyst who has been working alongside you for three months. They've attended every meeting with you, read every email you've sent and received, reviewed every document in your shared drive. When you ask them to help you prepare for a client meeting, they don't need you to explain the history of the relationship — they already know it. They synthesize what they know into what you need.

That is what Microsoft Graph grounding does for Copilot. You don't need to brief it every time. It already knows your context. You just need to ask the right question.

The honest caveat: the analogy breaks down when it comes to judgment and creativity. Your analyst builds genuine understanding and relationship intuition over time. Copilot's "knowledge" is a structured map of your data — incredibly useful, but not a substitute for the contextual judgment you bring. The output it generates is always a first draft, not a final verdict. Microsoft itself is explicit about this in its product documentation: *"Remember that Copilot generates a draft. You'll need to verify and modify details to make sure it's accurate and fits your tone and style."*

Read that sentence carefully. It is not a liability disclaimer buried in fine print. It is honest product guidance from Microsoft — and it is good professional practice.

## 5. The Five Prompting Techniques

Now we get to the core of this chapter.

Microsoft 365 Copilot has access to your organizational context. It has sophisticated language models coordinating its responses. It is, architecturally speaking, a remarkable tool. But none of that matters if you don't know how to talk to it.

Prompting is not a technical skill. It is a communication skill. The same way a well-constructed question to a colleague gets you a better answer than a vague one, a well-constructed prompt gets you better output from Copilot. The techniques below are not tricks — they are frameworks for clarity. Learn them, practice them, and they become second nature.

:::{figure} ../images/ch05-five-techniques.png

:align: center

The five prompting techniques that separate average Copilot users from power users. Each addresses a different challenge: persona, reasoning transparency, learning from examples, requirement clarity, and critical pressure-testing.
:::

---

### Technique 1: Role-Based Prompting

**The core idea:** Before asking Copilot to do something, tell it who it is.

This sounds almost comically simple. It is also the technique that produces the most immediate and dramatic improvement in output quality for most users.

Here is why it works: language models like the one powering Microsoft 365 Copilot don't have a single fixed "voice" or perspective. They adapt their reasoning, vocabulary, tone, and framing based on the context they're given. When you assign a role — *"Act as a veteran commercial real estate underwriter with 20 years of experience"* — you are not just changing the tone. You are shifting the entire conceptual frame from which Copilot approaches the task. The criteria it applies, the risks it looks for, the language it uses, the depth of analysis it attempts — all of these shift to match the assigned role.

:::{figure} ../images/ch05-role-based-prompting.png
:label: fig-ch05-role-based
:alt: Illustration of role-based prompting — user assigns a specific professional role to Copilot, which then responds with the expertise, vocabulary, and analytical frame of that role
:width: 80%
:align: center

Role-Based Prompting transforms a generic request into a professional-grade inquiry by anchoring Copilot's response in the expertise, analytical frame, and vocabulary of a specific role.
:::

**The analogy:** Think about what happens when you call a law firm and ask a question. If you call the main line and speak to a receptionist, you get a polite general answer. If you ask to speak to the partner who handles commercial real estate transactions, you get a different kind of answer entirely — one that draws on specific expertise, that sees the risks you didn't think to ask about, that speaks in the language of your actual problem.

Role-Based Prompting is how you route your request to the right expert, even when the expert is an AI.

Where the analogy breaks down: a real expert has genuine experiential judgment, client relationship memory, and liability stake in their advice. Copilot's role adoption is sophisticated pattern matching, not lived expertise. You still bring the judgment. Copilot brings the synthesis and first draft.

**The revolution this enables:** Consider what it means for a compliance analyst to prompt Copilot as a *"skeptical bank examiner reviewing this policy document for OCC alignment gaps."* Or for a relationship manager to prompt as a *"CFO of a mid-market manufacturing company who is skeptical about borrowing right now."* Or for an operations manager to prompt as a *"Six Sigma process improvement consultant looking for waste and bottlenecks."* Each role unlocks a different analytical lens — applied instantly, at scale, to your actual Helm Bank materials.

**Prompting template:**

```
Act as a [specific role with relevant background].
Your task is to [specific task].
[Additional context about what you need.]
```

**Helm Bank examples:**

```
Act as a cynical, veteran CRE underwriter with 20 years of experience 
at a Southeast regional bank. Review the following property financial 
summary and flag every assumption you would push back on in an 
underwriting committee discussion.

[Paste or reference the financial summary]
```

```
Act as a BSA/AML compliance officer at an international gateway bank with 
deep experience in OFAC screening and foreign national KYC. Preparing for 
a quarterly regulatory review. Read the following internal process document 
and identify any language that could raise questions from an OCC or FDIC 
examiner, particularly around enhanced due diligence for high-risk 
international clients and cross-border wire documentation practices.
```

```
Act as a bilingual (English/Spanish) relationship manager at a Miami-based 
international bank who has known this Latin American client for five years. 
Based on the following account summary and recent correspondence, draft a 
renewal conversation agenda — in English, with key phrases also in Spanish 
— that acknowledges the relationship history, anticipates the client's 
concerns about U.S. interest rate environment from a Latin American 
investor perspective, and references their use of our HelmInOne 
multi-currency wire platform.
```

:::{tip}
**Role-Based Prompting Power Move**

Add a behavioral instruction alongside the role: *"Be direct. Do not soften your feedback. Flag problems explicitly."* Copilot's default tendency is to be somewhat diplomatic. In professional banking contexts, you often need it to be blunt. The role assignment plus the behavioral instruction together produce output that reads like a tough internal review, not a polished PR document.
:::

---

### Technique 2: Chain-of-Thought Reasoning

**The core idea:** Ask Copilot to show its work before giving you the final answer.

This is one of the most counterintuitive techniques, because the instinct is always to ask for the answer — not the reasoning process. But in complex analytical tasks, asking for reasoning first produces dramatically better final answers. Here is why.

:::{figure} ../images/ch05-chain-of-thought.png
:label: fig-ch05-chain-of-thought
:alt: Illustration of Chain-of-Thought Reasoning — a prompt asking for step-by-step reasoning produces visible intermediate steps before the final answer, creating a more transparent and reliable output
:width: 80%
:align: center

Chain-of-Thought Reasoning makes Copilot's analytical process visible — each intermediate step can be reviewed, corrected, or redirected before the final answer, producing more reliable output for complex banking decisions.
:::

When you ask Copilot directly for a conclusion, it pattern-matches toward the most statistically likely answer given the context. When you ask it to reason through the problem step-by-step, it builds each conclusion on the previous one — and that structured process tends to produce more coherent, internally consistent analysis. More importantly, it makes the reasoning visible, which means you can catch errors in the logic before they propagate into the conclusion.

**The analogy:** Think about a credit memo versus a credit decision. A credit decision (approve/decline, with a rate) is the conclusion. A credit memo is the reasoning chain — market analysis, borrower financials, collateral assessment, risk mitigants, stress testing — that makes the decision reviewable, auditable, and defensible. When Copilot shows its reasoning chain, you get the memo instead of just the verdict. That is almost always more useful, because you can engage with the analysis rather than just accepting or rejecting the conclusion.

Where the analogy breaks down: a credit memo is built on real due diligence by humans who are accountable for their analysis. Copilot's reasoning chain is sophisticated generation — it should be reviewed for logical consistency, not treated as due diligence.

**The prompting template:**

```
Walk me through your reasoning step-by-step before giving me the final answer.
[Then state the task clearly.]
```

**Helm Bank examples:**

```
I need to evaluate whether to recommend our bank's multi-currency wire 
service and international cash management suite to a Colombian multinational 
prospect who currently uses a large U.S. bank for their USD wire operations 
but is frustrated with the service quality and lack of Spanish-speaking 
support.

Walk me through your reasoning step-by-step: what factors should I 
consider, what are the trade-offs, what objections they are likely to raise, 
and what questions do I need answered about their current banking relationship 
before making a recommendation? Then give me a final recommendation framework.
```

```
A foreign national client who generates $4.2M in average deposits across 
three multi-currency accounts is asking us to match a competitor's offer 
that includes a higher yield and a Spanish-speaking dedicated relationship 
manager. They also mentioned the competitor offers better MT940 
reconciliation exports for their Colombia-based accounting team.

Walk me through your reasoning on whether to negotiate, match the offer, 
or let this client leave — considering both the financial and relationship 
dimensions — then give me a prioritized recommendation with the key 
risks clearly stated.
```

:::{dropdown} Why Chain-of-Thought Works at a Technical Level
At the model architecture level, Chain-of-Thought prompting works because it forces the language model to generate tokens that represent intermediate reasoning before generating the final answer token sequence. Each step in the chain conditions the next step — creating a more constrained, coherent generation path than a direct-to-conclusion prompt allows.

In plain language: when you ask for the answer directly, Copilot takes a shortcut. When you ask for the reasoning first, it has to build the bridge piece by piece, and those intermediate pieces keep it on track. The final answer that comes out of a reasoning chain is usually more defensible than one that appeared directly.

This is also why Chain-of-Thought is particularly valuable in compliance-adjacent banking tasks: the reasoning chain is auditable. You can show it to a senior colleague or a regulator and explain *why* the analysis landed where it did.
:::

### Technique 3: Few-Shot Prompting

**The core idea:** Show Copilot what "good" looks like before asking it to produce something new.

This technique is borrowed directly from machine learning — "few-shot learning" is the ability of a model to generalize from a small number of examples. Applied to prompting, it means you give Copilot two or three strong examples of the output you want, and then ask it to produce a new output in the same style.

:::{figure} ../images/ch05-few-shot-prompting.png
:label: fig-ch05-few-shot
:alt: Illustration of few-shot prompting — three example documents labeled Strong, Strong, and Weak feed into Copilot, which then generates a fourth document matching the pattern of the strong examples
:width: 80%
:align: center

Few-Shot Prompting teaches Copilot by example — providing strong and weak examples establishes quality standards that Copilot replicates in new output, far more effectively than describing what you want in abstract terms.
:::

**The analogy:** Think about how you onboard a new junior analyst who has strong technical skills but no institutional knowledge. You don't hand them a style guide and tell them to write like the senior team. You hand them three or four examples of excellent credit memos written by your best people and say: *"Write at this level. Match this structure. Aim for this depth."* They look at the examples, internalize the pattern, and produce work that fits the institutional standard.

This is exactly what few-shot prompting does. The examples are your institutional standard, communicated directly to Copilot.

Where the analogy breaks down: your analyst internalizes examples through genuine understanding, not pattern matching. Copilot extracts statistical patterns from your examples — which means if your examples have a systematic flaw or bias, Copilot will replicate that flaw. The "garbage in, garbage out" principle applies here more directly than in most other techniques.

**The prompting template:**

```
Here are [number] examples of [type of output].
[Example 1 — labeled "Strong" or "Weak" as appropriate]
[Example 2]
[Example 3]

Now [state the task]. Match the style, depth, and structure of the strong examples.
```

**Helm Bank examples:**

```
Here are three examples of international client relationship summary memos 
that our team considers high quality — each covering a Latin American 
multinational or foreign national client — and one example of a weaker memo.

[EXAMPLE 1 — Strong: paste text — note bilingual elements and cross-border 
account context]
[EXAMPLE 2 — Strong: paste text]
[EXAMPLE 3 — Weak: paste text]

Now write a relationship summary memo for the following international client 
using the structure, depth, and bilingual sensitivity of the strong examples. 
Here is the raw account data:

Here are two examples of the way our compliance team prefers to write 
policy exceptions — concise, specific, with clear risk mitigation language 
and no ambiguous qualifiers.

**Few-Shot Prompting and Confidential Data**

When using examples to train Copilot's style, be thoughtful about what you paste in. Real client names, account numbers, and non-public financial information should be anonymized in your examples before pasting them into a Copilot prompt. Use placeholder names (Client A, Company X) and rounded figures in your examples. The style instruction works just as well with anonymized content, and it keeps your prompting practice in alignment with Helm Bank's data handling standards.
:::

**Advanced application — the "Four Examples" method:**

For complex output like proposals or memos, try four examples: two strong, one acceptable, one weak. Ask Copilot to explain what makes the strong examples better before generating new output. This forces a brief analysis step (a variation of Chain-of-Thought) that tends to sharpen the generation significantly.

---

### Technique 4: Reverse Prompting

**The core idea:** Instead of you asking Copilot a question, ask Copilot to ask *you* questions.

This is the technique that most surprises people when they first try it — because it inverts the natural instinct. We assume we know what we need and we try to describe it. The problem is that we often don't know what we need precisely enough to describe it well. The resulting prompt is vague, the output is generic, and we conclude that Copilot isn't that useful.

Reverse Prompting short-circuits this by letting Copilot do the requirement-gathering.

:::{figure} ../images/ch05-reverse-prompting.png
:label: fig-ch05-reverse-prompting
:alt: Illustration of Reverse Prompting — user asks Copilot to interview them with clarifying questions, Copilot responds with a structured list of questions, user answers, and Copilot generates precise output
:width: 80%
:align: center

Reverse Prompting turns the dynamic around — instead of struggling to articulate requirements precisely, you let Copilot interview you. The questions Copilot asks reveal what it needs to know to produce genuinely useful output.
:::

**The analogy:** Think about the difference between walking into a tailor with a vague request ("I need a suit for an important meeting") versus answering a tailor's structured questions ("What is the occasion? What is the dress code of the venue? What is your typical posture preference for jacket length? Do you prefer a two-button or three-button closure?"). The tailor who asks questions produces a significantly better outcome than the tailor who takes your vague description and starts cutting fabric. Reverse Prompting makes Copilot the skilled tailor.

Where the analogy breaks down: a skilled tailor's questions are based on deep craft knowledge and an understanding of *your specific situation*. Copilot's questions are good but may not always surface the most important uncertainty for your specific task. After it asks its questions, you should also add anything it didn't think to ask.

**The prompting template:**

```
I need your help with [general description of task]. 
Before you start, ask me any questions you need to 
perfectly understand my request and produce exactly 
what I need. Don't proceed until I've answered.
```

**Helm Bank examples:**

```
I need to write a presentation for our quarterly business review 
with the commercial lending leadership team. Before you start, 
ask me any questions you need to understand exactly what this 
presentation should accomplish, who will be in the room, what 
data I have available, and what format works best for our team.
```

```
I want to draft a proposal letter to a prospect we've been 
courting for six months in the commercial construction space. 
Before writing anything, ask me everything you need to know 
about the relationship history, the prospect's current banking 
situation, what we're proposing, and the tone I want.
```

:::{tip}
**The Reverse Prompting Power Move**

After Copilot asks its questions and you answer them, add one more line: *"Is there anything else you need to know, or any assumption you're making that I should verify?"* This second-level check often surfaces a critical variable that the first round of questions missed — particularly on complex, multi-stakeholder tasks.
:::

**When Reverse Prompting works best:**

- Complex, multi-part deliverables (proposals, presentations, strategy memos)
- Tasks where the audience or context matters significantly to the output
- Situations where you're not sure exactly what you want — but you know it when you see it
- Tasks you're doing for the first time with Copilot and haven't yet developed a strong prompt template for

---

### Technique 5: The Sparring Partner

**The core idea:** Ask Copilot to push back on your ideas, not agree with them.

This is the most advanced technique in the set — and for many banking professionals, the most valuable. The default behavior of any AI assistant is to be helpful, which in practice means it tends to be agreeable. It will draft your memo, it will refine your proposal, it will polish your arguments. What it will not do, unless you specifically ask it to, is tell you where your thinking is weak.

The Sparring Partner technique flips this. You give Copilot a role defined by skepticism, and then you present your best thinking and ask it to attack it.

:::{figure} ../images/ch05-copilot-memory.png
:label: fig-ch05-sparring
:alt: Illustration of the Sparring Partner technique — a banker presenting their pitch on one side and Copilot in the role of a skeptical CFO or credit committee member on the other, pushing back with tough questions and alternative interpretations
:width: 80%
:align: center

The Sparring Partner technique — Copilot assigned the role of a skeptical counterpart (CFO, credit committee, OCC examiner) pushes back on your best thinking, revealing weaknesses before they become problems in the real conversation.
:::

**The analogy:** Think about moot court in law school. Law students argue their cases against experienced lawyers who deliberately try to find every hole in the argument. The goal is not to win the moot court — it is to discover every weakness in the case before the real court appearance, when the stakes are real. The sparring session is where the case gets stronger.

For banking professionals, the Sparring Partner technique is how you pressure-test your thinking before a credit committee review, a client negotiation, a board presentation, or a regulatory examination. Copilot, assigned the role of your toughest critic, will find the holes that your own confirmation bias is inclined to skip over.

Where the analogy breaks down: a real sparring partner in moot court knows the law, has genuine judgment, and cares about the outcome. Copilot's pushback is sophisticated, but it is still pattern-matched critique rather than genuine adversarial reasoning. It may miss highly specific or contextual weaknesses that a real expert would catch. Use it as a first filter, not the only one.

**The prompting template:**

```
Play the role of [specific skeptical counterpart]. 
I am going to present [my idea/proposal/analysis].
Push back hard. Don't flatter me. Identify every weakness, 
every assumption, every place where my reasoning is 
vulnerable. Be direct.

[Present your idea/proposal/analysis]
```

**Helm Bank examples:**

```
Play the role of a skeptical CFO of a \$200M revenue manufacturing 
company who is cautious about taking on additional debt in the 
current rate environment. I'm going to pitch you on refinancing 
your current term loan with Helm Bank and adding a revolving 
credit facility. Push back hard. Don't accept my assumptions. 
Tell me what objections you'd actually raise.

Here is my pitch: [present your pitch]
```

```
Play the role of a lead OCC examiner conducting a safety and 
soundness review. I am going to present our commercial real estate 
concentration management framework. Identify every area where 
the examiner is likely to ask hard questions, where our documentation 
is thin, and where our reasoning may not hold up under scrutiny.

Here is the framework: [paste the framework]
```

```
Play the role of a credit committee member who has seen five 
similar credits go bad in the last two years. I'm presenting 
a \$7.5M construction loan for a mixed-use development in 
Broward County. Find the weaknesses in my credit story. 
Do not soften your feedback.

Here is my credit summary: [paste the summary]
```

:::{warning}
**The Sparring Partner and Overconfidence**

The Sparring Partner technique is extraordinarily useful — but it carries one risk worth naming. Copilot's pushback is sophisticated enough that it may feel comprehensive. It may not be. There are scenarios, contextual nuances, and relationship factors that a human expert will surface that Copilot will miss. Run your ideas through the Sparring Partner to improve them. Then also run them through an actual human colleague you trust. The combination — AI critique followed by human review — produces the best outcome.

## 6. The Goldilocks Zone of Prompt Length

Now that you understand the five techniques, there is one meta-principle that governs all of them: **the length and precision of your prompt determines the quality of your output, and there is a precision sweet spot — not too short, not too long.**

:::{figure} ../images/ch05-goldilocks-prompt-length.png
:label: fig-ch05-goldilocks
:alt: Three-part infographic showing the Goldilocks Zone for prompt length — Too Short produces generic output, Too Long loses the model in detail, Just Right with Context plus Goal plus Format plus Constraints produces precise professional results
:width: 80%
:align: center

The Goldilocks Zone of prompt length — precision in four dimensions (Context, Goal, Format, Constraints) produces consistently better output than either minimal prompts or overly detailed instruction sets that obscure the actual request.
:::

**The "too short" failure mode:**

*"Write a memo about our Q2 commercial lending performance."*

This prompt has no context (who is reading it? what do they already know?), no specific goal (is this for leadership? compliance? the board?), no format guidance (length? tone? structure?), and no constraints (what should it include? what should it avoid?). Copilot will generate something. It will be polished. It will be almost entirely useless for your specific purpose, because it is optimized for the generic version of the task rather than your version.

**The "too long" failure mode:**

Some users, having learned that detail helps, overcompensate. They write prompts that are five paragraphs of background, instruction, counter-instruction, caveats, and competing requirements. At a certain level of complexity, this actually degrades output — the model gets pulled in multiple directions by conflicting guidance, and the result is incoherent or over-hedged.

**The Goldilocks zone — the four-component prompt:**

The research and practitioner experience on prompting converges on a consistent structure for most business tasks. A good prompt has four components:

1. **Context:** Who you are, what situation you're in, what Copilot needs to know to frame its response appropriately
2. **Goal:** What you want Copilot to produce — specific, not vague
3. **Format:** How you want the output structured (bullet list, formal memo, executive summary, table, numbered recommendations, etc.)
4. **Constraints:** What to include, what to avoid, tone, length, any requirements that bound the output

These four components can usually be covered in three to five sentences, or a short paragraph. That is the sweet spot.

**The Helm Bank four-component prompt in action:**

```
Context: I'm a commercial relationship manager at Helm Bank preparing 
for a renewal conversation with a \$15M commercial real estate client 
who has been with the bank for eight years. Their portfolio has performed 
well, but a competitor has approached them with a more aggressive rate.

Goal: Draft talking points for the renewal conversation that emphasize 
our relationship history and service quality without immediately 
conceding on rate.

Format: A bulleted list of five to seven talking points, each with 
a one-sentence expansion.

Constraints: Keep the tone confident but not defensive. Do not include 
any specific rate numbers or commitments — I'll handle those in the 
room. The client is sophisticated and has heard every standard pitch before.
```

That prompt takes thirty seconds to write. The output it produces is immediately usable — not a generic draft that requires fifteen minutes of editing to make relevant.

```{mermaid}

    style F fill:#f4a400,color:#fff
```

**A note on iterating:**

You rarely need to get the perfect prompt on the first try. Copilot conversations are threaded — your follow-up messages have context from everything that came before. Think of prompting as a conversation: start with a good four-component prompt, review the output, and then refine with specific follow-up instructions. *"That's good — now make the tone more direct"* or *"Remove the second and fourth points and expand the third into two separate bullets"* or *"Rewrite this for a non-banker who doesn't know our internal terminology."* The follow-up prompt is often where the real refinement happens.

## 7. Try This: Run the Same Banking Question Five Ways

Here is where the theory becomes practice. This exercise produces one of the clearest demonstrations of how much the technique matters — more than the question itself.

**The baseline question:**

> *"How should Helm Bank communicate with a Latin American multinational client who is concerned about recent U.S. regulatory changes affecting foreign national wire transfers and is asking whether to consolidate their banking relationship elsewhere?"*

This is a real strategic question that any relationship manager, compliance officer, or business development officer at Helm Bank might face. It is specific enough to be meaningful, general enough to work without confidential client data.

**Run it five times — once with each technique:**

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} Technique 1: Role-Based
```
Act as a veteran international banking relationship manager with 15 years 
of experience serving Latin American multinational clients at U.S. gateway 
banks. How should Helm Bank communicate with a Latin American multinational 
client who is concerned about recent U.S. regulatory changes affecting 
foreign national wire transfers and is asking whether to consolidate their 
banking relationship elsewhere?
```
*What to notice:* The response should have a notably more specific, client-relationship-focused, and culturally-aware character than a generic answer. It should reference regulatory context (BSA/AML, OFAC), communication strategies in Spanish, and the value of boutique personalized service vs. a large bank's standardized approach.
:::
:::{tab-item} Technique 2: Chain-of-Thought
```
Walk me through your reasoning step by step — considering 
all the relevant regulatory, relationship, and competitive factors — 
before giving me a final recommendation on how Helm Bank should 
communicate with a Latin American multinational client who is 
concerned about recent U.S. regulatory changes affecting foreign 
national wire transfers and is asking whether to consolidate their 
banking relationship elsewhere.
```
*What to notice:* The response should show its work — regulatory context analysis, client relationship assessment, competitive positioning, communication strategy options — before landing on recommendations. The reasoning chain is the value.
:::
:::{tab-item} Technique 3: Few-Shot
```
Here are two examples of how our relationship team has handled 
similar client retention situations well:

Example 1 — Strong: [paste a real or hypothetical example 
of a well-handled regulatory concern conversation with a 
Latin American business client]

Example 2 — Strong: [paste another strong example — perhaps 
a bilingual client memo that addressed a compliance concern 
clearly and retained the relationship]

Now give me a recommendation for how Helm Bank should communicate 
with a Latin American multinational client concerned about regulatory 
changes affecting their wires. Match the style and specificity of 
the strong examples.
```
*What to notice:* The output should mirror the structure and depth of your examples. If your examples were concise, bilingual, and relationship-forward, the new output will be too.
:::
:::{tab-item} Technique 4: Reverse Prompting
```
I need a recommendation on how Helm Bank should communicate with 
a Latin American multinational client who is concerned about recent 
U.S. regulatory changes affecting foreign national wire transfers and 
is asking whether to consolidate their banking relationship elsewhere. 
Before you give me an answer, ask me any questions you need 
to give me the most useful possible recommendation.
```
*What to notice:* Copilot should ask about the specific client relationship history, wire volume, what regulatory changes they're referencing, the client's primary language preferences, and Helm Bank's current service model for this client. Your answers will produce a significantly more tailored recommendation.
:::
:::{tab-item} Technique 5: Sparring Partner
```
Play the role of a skeptical Latin American CFO who has had 
frustrating experiences with U.S. banks not understanding cross-border 
compliance requirements and who is genuinely considering moving their 
company's banking relationship. I'm going to explain why they should 
stay with Helm Bank despite their concerns about new wire regulations. 
Push back hard. Tell me where my arguments are weak.

My proposal: I'll explain that Helm Bank's boutique size means personal 
attention, our BSA/AML and OFAC teams are specialized in Latin American 
client profiles, and I'll offer a dedicated review session with our 
compliance team to walk through exactly which transactions are affected 
and why — in Spanish.
```
*What to notice:* This output should be genuinely challenging. A good Sparring Partner response will push back on the boutique bank's regulatory resources vs. a large bank's, question whether a compliance meeting solves a business efficiency problem, and surface concerns about ongoing regulatory risk to their transaction volume.
:::
::::

**Compare the five outputs.** They should be meaningfully different — not just in tone, but in substance, depth, and practical utility. That difference is what you're learning to produce deliberately.

:::{note}
**What to Record After the Exercise**

Keep notes on:
- Which technique produced the most immediately useful output for this type of question?
- Which technique surprised you most?
- Where would you combine techniques? (Role-Based + Chain-of-Thought is a particularly powerful combination for complex analytical tasks.)
- What would you add to refine each prompt further?

Your prompting instincts improve with every iteration. The professionals who become power users of Microsoft 365 Copilot are not the ones who got lucky on the first try — they are the ones who treated each prompt like a hypothesis to be tested and refined.

## 8. Putting It Together: Your First Week Prompting Plan

This course gives you the frameworks. What moves you from "I understand the techniques" to "I use them automatically" is repetition — applied to real Helm Bank work, on real tasks, this week.

Here is a concrete five-day prompting plan:

```{list-table} Helm Bank First-Week Prompting Plan
:header-rows: 1
:name: table-prompting-plan

* - Day
  - Technique
  - Task to Try at Helm Bank
* - Monday
  - Role-Based Prompting
  - Assign a relevant professional role and use it to analyze a document or memo you're currently working on — e.g., act as a bilingual international banking specialist reviewing a client communication for tone and accuracy
* - Tuesday
  - Chain-of-Thought
  - Use Copilot to reason through a decision or recommendation you need to make this week — e.g., whether to escalate a cross-border wire flagged for enhanced review, with step-by-step reasoning before the conclusion
* - Wednesday
  - Few-Shot
  - Pull two or three examples of a document type your team produces regularly (client relationship summaries, wire instruction confirmations, foreign national loan cover letters), and ask Copilot to generate a new one in the same style
* - Thursday
  - Reverse Prompting
  - Let Copilot interview you for a client proposal, bilingual presentation, or international deal summary you need to develop — answer its questions, then review the output
* - Friday
  - Sparring Partner
  - Present one of your current client retention strategies or international deal recommendations to Copilot in the Sparring Partner mode and see what objections surface
```

By Friday, you will have hands-on experience with all five techniques applied to real work. That is more practical prompting practice than most Copilot users accumulate in their first three months.

---

## 9. Productive Struggle Problem

You are a senior relationship manager at Helm Bank. Your most important portfolio client — a Colombian multinational company with $18M in deposits, regular multi-currency wire activity through HelmInOne, and a seven-year relationship with the bank — has just informed you that a large U.S. bank is courting them aggressively. The competitor is offering a higher yield on their operating accounts, a dedicated Spanish-speaking relationship team in New York, and a seamless MT940 export integration with the client's ERP system.

You have thirty minutes before the client calls to discuss. You need: a clear understanding of whether the competitor's offer is genuinely superior or primarily a negotiating tactic, a retention strategy that emphasizes Helm Bank's international boutique advantages over a large bank's standardized approach, and talking points — ideally with key phrases available in Spanish — that draw on the seven-year relationship history and the bank's deep Latin American market expertise.

You have access to Microsoft 365 Copilot and the five techniques from this chapter.

**The challenge:** Design a sequence of Copilot prompts — using at least three of the five techniques — that you would actually run in the next twenty-five minutes to prepare for this call. Write out each prompt in full, explain which technique it uses and why you chose it for that step, and describe what you expect from each output.

There is no single right answer. There are better and worse sequences, and the quality of your thinking about *why* you're choosing each technique is as important as the prompt itself.

---

## Discussion

**Prompting as a Professional Skill**

The five techniques in this chapter are not software features — they are communication frameworks that work because of how language models process context. As Microsoft continues to evolve Microsoft 365 Copilot, the specific mechanics will change. The principles will not.

Consider: In what ways does prompting Copilot resemble briefing a highly capable junior colleague? In what ways does it differ? What does that comparison reveal about where human judgment remains irreplaceable in the AI-assisted workflow?

**Discussion Guidelines:**

Your response should engage substantively with the comparison between prompting AI and briefing a human colleague. Include at least one specific example from your own professional experience — either an experience where clear communication dramatically improved a colleague's output, or a case where a vague request produced work that missed the mark entirely. Apply that experience to what you've learned about prompting.

Support your perspective with at least one credible source — this might be something from the Microsoft 365 Copilot official documentation, the Skilling Center resources at adoption.microsoft.com/copilot/skilling-center/, or a relevant piece of research on human-AI collaboration in professional settings.

After posting your response, engage with **at least two classmates** by extending or challenging a specific claim they made — not just affirming it. "I agree because..." is not a sufficient peer response. "I'd push back on your claim that X because I've seen Y, which suggests Z" is.

**Do not summarize or repeat what you read.** Share what you think — grounded in evidence — about what this means for how Helm Bank professionals should work going forward.

## Leader's Takeaway

Microsoft 365 Copilot is not a feature you turn on. It is a capability you develop — in yourself, and in your team.

The infrastructure is in place. The security architecture is sound. The intelligence layer that grounds Copilot in your organizational context is active. The tools are available at m365.cloud.microsoft right now.

What remains is the skill — specifically, the prompting skill that determines whether Copilot becomes a transformative part of how Helm Bank works or sits as an underutilized line item in the software budget.

The five techniques in this chapter are not exotic. They are communication principles applied to a new kind of tool. Role-Based Prompting is how you brief a specialist. Chain-of-Thought is how you ask for a memo, not just a verdict. Few-Shot is how you onboard a new analyst with examples. Reverse Prompting is how you let the expert interview you before the work begins. The Sparring Partner is how you moot-court your best thinking before the real conversation.

These techniques are learnable. They improve with repetition. And the professionals on your team who develop fluency with them fastest will not just be more productive individually — they will become the informal teachers who spread that capability to everyone around them.

That is the compound return on investing in this skill. It is not linear — it multiplies.
